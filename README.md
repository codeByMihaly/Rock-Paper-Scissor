# Rock Paper Scissors

This project is part of **The Odin Project – Foundations** curriculum.  
The goal was to build the classic *Rock Paper Scissors* game in JavaScript, first in the console, then with a simple user interface in the browser.

 **Live Demo:**  https://codebymihaly.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissor/

##  Features

- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer  
- Random computer choice each round  
- Score tracking for player vs. computer  
- Simple, clean UI (buttons + result display)  
- Game result messages after each round  

##  What I Used

- **HTML5** – basic structure and UI elements  
- **CSS3** – simple styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – game logic, DOM manipulation, event handling  

##  What I Learned

- Structuring a small JavaScript project  
- Using functions to separate logic (getComputerChoice, playRound, etc.)  
- Working with conditionals to determine the winner  
- Handling user input via button clicks  
- Updating the DOM dynamically to show results and scores
